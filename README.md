# Hi there, I'm Russell Canfield! 👋

### Principal Engineer & Architect | Open Source Enthusiast

I am a seasoned **Principal Frontend Engineer and Architect** with over **15 years of experience** building scalable web applications. My passion lies in solving complex architectural challenges, from large-scale monoliths to distributed microservices and microfrontends.

Currently, I'm focused on building developer tools that leverage **AI** to improve coding workflows and exploring advanced patterns in **Module Federation**.
